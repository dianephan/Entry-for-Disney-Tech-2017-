Disney has the power to create a universal feeling for people of all ages and backgrounds to experience by combining and enhancing the senses of sound and sight into their works, from theme park rides, to fireworks, to animation on the big screen. The magical innovations on Disney’s ground over the decade has enhanced my visit to the Disneyland theme parks each time. As a young girl, the animatronics inside the themed rides have captivated my attention because they have always been so overwhelmingly mesmerizing and interactive towards each guest. Disney has the power to make each animatronic come to life from a small screen and contribute to a story that evokes emotions and imagination in its audience. “It’s a Small World” and “The Haunted Mansion” rides have always been my favorite because it demonstrates the careful attention to details in the motion and design of each character in its unique and themed setting. Disney’s magic of combining the best of art and unique technology has never failed to immerse me into a world of happiness, escapism, and nostalgia. 


Every trip to the Disneyland theme park has been a privilege to me due to the fact that I come from a low-income family and struggle as an Asian female in the hustle bustle of the Bay Area. Although I grew up in the Bay, my community lacks women pursuing a career in technology, which made it difficult for me to establish a career path at an early age. Attending the Grace Hopper Conference will allow me to build a powerful support system with other females across the globe, gain inspirational insights, and cultivate my strength to become a high achieving woman in computing. Similar to being at Disneyland and connecting to other guests who share an enthusiasm for storytelling, the conference will grant me memories of finding women who are similar to me in which we appreciate the artistic and creative usage of technology in engineering. I will be able to learn how I can encourage future generations to become proactive and supportive towards their peers of different genders and backgrounds at a younger age before they attend college.
